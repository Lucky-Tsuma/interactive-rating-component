## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS framework


### What I learned

Used this project to recap on my HTML and CSS. Used boostrap to speed up development.
Something to remember is to always add the **container-fluid** class to the body to make the page responsive when using bootstrap

```reminder
<body class = "container-fluid">Body here</body>
```
### Continued development

I will be focusing more on:
1. Bootstrap to fasten up development.
2. SASS to gain familiarity with it.
3. [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to document my projects better.
